ImageImp development documentation.

The following is a description of the overall structure of the data model and
actions which can be taken in the application.

Definitions:
- Person : A single person.
- Group : A group of people.
- Photo : A photograph of a single person.
- Image : A computer image file. Represents a photograph.
- Album : A collection of people who were photographed in order and/or have
  pictures assigned to them. This will always be a subset of the people in a
  single group.

Collections of people are sorted into groups. Each group of people can have
several albums. Each person in the group can:

- Be photographed in a specific album. This means the person has been photographed in
  order along with the people in the group, and there exists a date/time at which
  the photographer started taking pictures for this person. The person is then
  said to be a "Photographed Person". A Person who isn't known to be
  photographed at a specific date/time is said to be "Unphotographed Person".
  This does not state whether the person has any actual pictures assigned.

- Have pictures assigned to them. This can be a manual or automatic
  assignment. Only a "Photographed Person" can have pictures automatically
  assigned to him, but all People can have pictures manually assigned. A
  person with photographs (either automatic or manually assigned) is said to
  be a "Person With Pictures".

Models:

	Groups : Represents a list of all the groups in the database. Always
	returns all the available groups.

	People : At any given time returns either an empty list, or all the people
	in a specific group.


= Album creation process =
Imageimp creates 3 files:
- $HOME/Local Settings/Temp/imageimp_create_album.cfg : contains 2 lines, which are
  the file names of the settings and data files for the album currently being
  imported.
- $IMAGEIMP_ROOT/export/album_$ID_data.txt : Contains a list of person
  name/image-file lines. person name and image file are each on a separate
  line.
- $IMAGEIMP_ROOT/export/album_$ID_settings.txt : Contains settings for the
  generated album which are parsed by the photoshop javascript. Lines in the
  settings file:
  * width
  * height
  * autofill
  * picture template
  * album template

SQL statements scribble:

* Get one picture for each person
select pictures.path, people.name from pictures join people on pictures.person_id = people.id where album_id = 3 group by people.name

* Override with explicit default pictures
select pictures.id, pictures.path, people.name from pictures join people on pictures.person_id = people.id join default_pictures on default_pictures.picture_id = pictures.id  where album_id = 3;
