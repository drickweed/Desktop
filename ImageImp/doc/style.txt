Include files:
	- Each include file starts with "#pragma once" to solve the problem of
	  multiple header inclusions. (This is known to work properly in linux and
	  on mingw)
	- Include files are grouped according to the library they belong to and
	  preceded by a commment specifying which library they are from, or
	  "Application headers" if the heades are application specific. For
	  example:

	  /** QT headers **/
	  #include <QList>
	  #include <QString>

	  /** Application headers **/
	  #include <imp/group.h>

Classes:
	- When overloading a method of an inherited class, document the method with
	"/** See <Library name> API **/" to refer to the documentation in the
	library's api. (Example : /** See QT API **/)
