Code documentation guidelines:


Coding guidelines:
- All private variables in the format m_var_name.
- accessors for all private variables in the form of varName (not getVarName).
- Document all classes, methods and variables.
- Whitespace cleanup (unneeded space, syntax, newline at end of file, tabs for indenting).
- Removed unneeded #includes.
- method format : camelCase / actionNoun.
- long method and variable names (attributes instead of attr, version instead of ver).
- class names same as file names.
- database schema documentation.
- incrementors in the form i++ whenever it doesn't matter.
- Document variables after their deleration
- Space between method and next method's documentation
