If that doesn't help, more info:</P>
<P align=left>

This issue can occur if one or more of the PCHealth components in your 
computer are damaged.

To resolve this issue:

</P>
<P align=left>

1. It is important to note if you have recently made alterations to your 
computer before this problem occurred, or if the Help and Support <br>
Center 
ever worked correctly. If you have recently made alterations to your 
computer before this problem occurred, try to undo the changes<br>
&nbsp;you made or 
uninstall the hardware or software that could have caused the issue. After 
you do so, test to determine if the issue is resolved, <br>
and if it is, skip 
the remaining steps. If the issue is not resolved, continue to the next 
step. </P>
<P align=left>

2. Remove the .cab files from the Packagestore folder, and then rebuild the 
original Help and Support Center:

   <br>
<br>
a. Click Start, click Run, type&nbsp; "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and 
then click OK to open a command prompt. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type "net stop helpsvc" (without 
the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

   <br>
b. Type "cd /d windir\pchealth\helpctr" (without the quotation marks), 
where windir is the Windows folder, and then press ENTER.<br>

   c. Type "rd packagestore /s /q" (without the quotation marks), and then 
press ENTER.

   <br>
d. Type "cd binaries" (without the quotation marks), and then press 
ENTER.

   <br>
e. Type "start /w helpsvc /svchost netsvcs /regserver /install" (without 
the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

   <br>
f.&nbsp; If any of the following processes are running, stop them: helpsvc.exe
   helphost.exe
   helpctr.exe <br>
<br>

      To stop a process, right-click the taskbar, and then click Task 
Manager. Click the Processes tab, click the process you want to stop, <br>
and 
then      click End Process.

   <br>
<br>
g. At the command prompt, type "net start helpsvc" (without the 
quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

<br>
<br>
3. If the Help and Support Center has not been customized by an OEM, skip 
to the next step. If the Help and Support Center has been<br>
&nbsp;customized by an 
OEM, completely refresh the Help and Support Center:

   <br>
<br>
a. Click Start, click Run, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and 
then click OK to open a command prompt. Type "net stop helpsvc" (without 
the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

   <br>
b. Type "cd /d windir\pchealth\helpctr" (without the quotation marks), 
where windir is the Windows folder, and then press ENTER.

   <br>
c. Type "rd packagestore /s /q" (without the quotation marks), and then 
press ENTER.

   <br>
d. Type "rd installedskus /s /q" (without the quotation marks), and then 
press ENTER.

   <br>
e. Type "cd binaries" (without the quotation marks), and then press 
ENTER.

   <br>
f. Type "start /w helpsvc /svchost netsvcs /regserver /install" (without 
the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

   <br>
g. Type "start /w helpsvc /register" (without the quotation marks), and 
then press ENTER.

   <br>
h. If any of the following processes are running, stop them: helpsvc.exe
   helphost.exe
   helpctr.exe <br>
<br>

      To stop a process, right-click the taskbar, and then click Task 
Manager. Click the Processes tab, click the process you want to stop, and 
then      click End Process.

   <br>
<br>
i. At the command prompt, type "net start helpsvc" (without the 
quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

      NOTE: The preceding procedure should not negatively affect an 
OEM-customized Help and Support Center. <br>
<br>
However, it does remove any other   
   .cab files from the Packstorage folder, such as the Windows XP support 
tools (which adds their table of contents into the Help and Support      
Center).

<br>
<br>
4. If the preceding steps do not resolve the issue, use the Windows XP 
CD-ROM to start your computer, and then run a repair (in-place upgrade) 
installation.

If this happened recently from no intervention on your part, (meaning that you have never previously used the Welcome Screen and was set to auto logon and that has changed) this has to do with the .Net Framework 1.1 update.

This update adds a new user called aspnet_wp account.  The aspnet account/user can only be deleted, not disabled. Information on what the user account would be needed for:
